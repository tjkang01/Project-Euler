# Homework 1

For this assignment, you will be exploring various regression tasks. There are two non-coding problems, and one coding problem. Please do the coding problem in Python, by directly modifying the given [distribution code](linreg.py).

## Important Files
- [homework1-regression.tex](homework1-regression.tex): This is the LaTeX file where you should write up your solutions for all three of the problems. Please make sure that you also push the compiled .pdf file that LaTeX generates. Also make sure to submit that pdf to Canvas.
- [linreg.py](linreg.py): This is the distro code for Problem 3 that implements simple linear regression. Please modify this for Problem 3.
- [congress-ages.png](congress-ages.png): This image is used for Problem 3
- [congress-ages.csv](congress-ages.csv): This is the data file you will use for Problem 3
- [harvardml.cls](harvardml.cls): This file contains various formatting for the problem sets. No need to change it.
- [common.sty](common.sty): This file contains various formatting for the problem sets. No need to change it.
